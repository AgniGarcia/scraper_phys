Eight years after this study was first published, Hanna and his team felt that they could go one step further by attempting to produce an even earlier, \"fully\" na\u00efve form of stem cells for use in similar procedures. As they were mulling over the idea, Hanna knew that this might be nearly\u2014if not altogether\u2014impossible to achieve. \"Our experience with producing similar cells in mice has taught us to expect challenging obstacles along the way,\" says Hanna.", "These cells normally suffer from genetic as well as epigenetic instability, and in the end they don't differentiate too well, which is key to proper embryonic development and a prerequisite for their integration into another animal's embryo. In fact, only about 1-3 percent of cells that have been transferred between species actually manage to integrate and contribute to development.", "To boost these numbers, the researchers in the new study inhibited two additional signaling pathways to produce na\u00efve human stem cells having a stable genome, relatively few gene regulation glitches, and most importantly, the ability to differentiate perfectly. The researchers also mutated an important gene that contributes to ", " stability, which resulted in not only competent but also competitive stem cells that can integrate well without causing damage to the host. \"We found a way to make human stem cells more competent, and competitive, increasing the chances for a successful transfer by about fivefold compared to what we were able to do in the past,\" concludes Hanna.", "While the previous study showed that human na\u00efve stem cells can differentiate into primordial germ cells\u2014the progenitors of egg or sperm cells\u2014the fully na\u00efve stem cells produced in the present study can also differentiate into extraembryonic tissues, the placenta and yolk sac cells that sustain the developing embryo. Such cells could be used, for example, as the source for developing synthetic embryos without the need for donor eggs. \"Reaching this state with mouse stem cells is particularly difficult to accomplish,\" Hanna explains, noting that \"human cells are apparently different.\"", "This is perhaps the most surprising finding that the researchers made\u2014highlighting the differences between the behavior of human and mouse stem cells, and between the different states of na\u00efve cells. These differences expose the work that still needs to be done in making the dream of developing \"made-to-order\" organs a real-world actuality.", "According to Hanna, understanding these differences will be pivotal for overcoming myriad issues still facing the field of stem cell research and application: \"If in the future we should wish to grow a pancreas in pigs for human transplantation, for example, we will have to take into account these massive evolutionary differences between species, beginning with mice and humans.\" For now, it would seem that Hanna and his team have taken a constructive leap in that direction.\n                                        \n                                                                                "]},

We live on the crust, a thin layer of solid rock. Between the crust and the iron-nickel core at the center of the planet is the mantle. It's not an ocean of lava\u2014instead it's more like solid rock, but hot and with an ability to move that drives plate tectonics at the surface.", "How can we have any idea what's going on in the mantle and the core? Seismic waves. As they ripple through the Earth after an earthquake, scientists on the surface can measure how and when the waves arrive at monitoring stations around the world. From those measurements, they can back-calculate how the waves were reflected and deflected by structures within the Earth, including layers of different densities. That's how we know where the boundaries are between the crust, mantle and core\u2014and partially how we know what they're made of.", "Ultra-low velocity zones sit at the bottom of the mantle, atop the liquid metal outer core. In these areas, seismic waves slow by as much as half, and density goes up by a third.", "Scientists initially thought that these zones were areas where the mantle was partially melted, and might be the source of magma for so-called \"hot spot\" volcanic regions like Iceland.", "\"But most of the things we call ultra-low velocity zones don't appear to be located beneath hot spot volcanoes,\" Thorne says, \"so that cannot be the whole story.\"", "So Thorne, postdoctoral scholar Surya Pachhai and colleagues from the Australian National University, Arizona State University and the University of Calgary set out to explore an alternate hypothesis: that the ultra-low velocity zones may be regions made of different rocks than the rest of the mantle\u2014and that their composition may hearken back to the early Earth.", "Perhaps, Thorne says, ultra-low velocity zones could be collections of iron oxide, which we see as rust at the surface but which can behave as a metal in the deep mantle. If that's the case, pockets of iron oxide just outside the core might influence the Earth's magnetic field which is generated just below.", "\"The physical properties of ultra-low velocity zones are linked to their origin,\" Pachhai says, \"which in turn provides important information about the thermal and chemical status, evolution and dynamics of Earth's lowermost mantle\u2014an essential part of mantle convection that drives plate tectonics.\"", "To get a clear picture, the researchers studied ultra-low velocity zones beneath the Coral Sea, between Australia and New Zealand. It's an ideal location because of an abundance of earthquakes in the area, which provide a high-resolution seismic picture of the core-mantle boundary. The hope was that high-resolution observations could reveal more about how ultra-low velocity zones are put together.", "But getting a seismic image of something through nearly 1800 miles of crust and mantle isn't easy. It's also not always conclusive\u2014a thick layer of low-velocity material might reflect seismic waves the same way as a thin layer of even lower-velocity material.", "So the team used a reverse-engineering approach.", "\"We can create a model of the Earth that includes ultra-low wave speed reductions,\" Pachhai says, \"and then run a computer simulation that tells us what the seismic waveforms would look like if that is what the Earth actually looked like.  Our next step is to compare those predicted recordings with the recordings that we actually have.\"", "Over hundreds of thousands of model runs, the method, called \"Bayesian inversion,\" yields a mathematically robust model of the interior with a good understanding of the uncertainties and trade-offs of different assumptions in the model.", "One particular question the researchers wanted to answer is whether there are internal structures, such as layers, within ultra-low velocity zones. The answer, according to the models, is that layers are highly likely. This is a big deal, because it shows the way to understanding how these zones came to be.", "\"To our knowledge this is the first study using such a Bayesian approach at this level of detail to investigate ultra-low velocity zones,\" Pachhai says, \"and it is also the first study to demonstrate strong layering within an ultra-low velocity zone.\"", "What does it mean that there are likely layers?", "More than four billion years ago, while dense iron was sinking to the core of the early Earth and lighter minerals were floating up into the mantle, a planetary object about the size of Mars may have slammed into the infant planet. The collision may have thrown debris into Earth's orbit that could have later formed the Moon. It also raised the temperature of the Earth significantly\u2014as you might expect from two planets smashing into each other.", "\"As a result, a large body of molten material, known as a magma ocean, formed,\" Pachhai says. The \"ocean\" would have consisted of rock, gases and crystals suspended in the magma.", "The ocean would have sorted itself out as it cooled, with dense materials sinking and layering on to the bottom of the mantle.", "Over the following billions of years, as the mantle churned and convected, the dense layer would have been pushed into small patches, showing up as the layered ultra-low velocity zones we see today.", "\"So the primary and most surprising finding is that the ultra-low velocity zones are not homogenous but contain strong heterogeneities (structural and compositional variations) within them,\" Pachhai says. \"This finding changes our view on the origin and dynamics of ultra-low velocity zones. We found that this type of ultra-low velocity zone can be explained by chemical heterogeneities created at the very beginning of the Earth's history and that they are still not well mixed after 4.5 billion years of mantle convection.\"", "The study provides some evidence of the origins of some ultra-low velocity zones, although there's also evidence to suggest different origins for others, such as melting of ocean crust that's sinking back into the mantle.

These cells would be exposed to the cancer protein that the researchers want the antibody to bind to, and researchers would pick out those that bind the best.", "Scientists would then introduce random ", " into the antibody sequence and screen these new proteins again. The process can be repeated many times until the best candidate emerges.", "About 10 years ago, as a graduate student at Harvard University, Esvelt developed a way to speed up directed evolution. This approach harnesses bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to help proteins evolve faster toward a desired function. The gene that the researchers hope to optimize is linked to a gene needed for bacteriophage survival, and the viruses compete against each other to optimize the protein. The selection process is run continuously, shortening each mutation round to the lifespan of the bacteriophage (which is about 20 minutes), and can be repeated many times, with no human intervention needed.", "Using this method, known as phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), directed evolution can be performed 1 billion times faster than traditional directed evolution experiments. However, evolution often fails to come up with a solution, requiring the researchers to guess which new set of conditions will do better.", "The technique described in the new ", " paper, which the researchers have named phage and robotics-assisted near-continuous evolution (PRANCE), can evolve 100 times as many populations in parallel, using different conditions.", "In the new PRANCE system, ", " populations (which can only infect a specific strain of bacteria) are grown in wells of a 96-well plate, instead of a single bioreactor. This allows for many more evolutionary trajectories to occur simultaneously. Each viral population is monitored by a ", " as it goes through the evolution process. When the virus succeeds in generating the desired protein, it produces a fluorescent protein that the robot can detect.", "\"The robot can babysit this population of viruses by measuring this readout, which allows it to see whether the viruses are performing well, or whether they're really struggling and something needs to be done to help them,\" DeBenedictis says.", "If the viruses are struggling to survive, meaning that the target protein is not evolving in the desired way, the robot can help save them from extinction by replacing the bacteria they're infecting with a different strain that makes it easier for the viruses to replicate. This prevents the population from dying out, which is a cause of failure for many directed evolution experiments.", "\"We can tune these evolutions in real-time, in direct response to how well these evolutions are occurring,\" Chory says. \"We can tell when an experiment is succeeding and we can change the environment, which gives us many more shots on goal, which is great from both a bioengineering perspective and a basic science perspective.\"", "In this study, the researchers used their new platform to engineer a molecule that allows viruses to encode their ", " in a new way.

Other possible applications for this kind of large-scale directed evolution include trying to evolve enzymes that degrade plastic more efficiently, or molecules that can edit the epigenome, similarly to how CRISPR can edit the genome, the researchers say.", "With this system, scientists can also gain a better understanding of the step-by-step process that leads to a particular evolutionary outcome. Because they can study so many populations in parallel, they can tweak factors such as the mutation rate, size of original population, and environmental conditions, and then analyze how those variations affect the outcome. This type of large-scale, controlled experiment could allow them to potentially answer fundamental questions about how evolution naturally occurs.", "\"Our system allows us to actually perform these evolutions with substantially more understanding of what's happening in the system,\" Chory says. \"We can learn about the history of the evolution, not just the end point.\"\n                                        \n                                                                                ", "\n                                                ", "\n                                            "]},

But in recent years, thanks to modern observational methods, the modern picture of planet formation has been refined and changed in very specific directions.", "The most striking change was triggered by a literal picture: The first image taken by the ALMA observation after its completion in 2014. The image showed the protoplanetary disk around the young star HL Tauri in unprecedented detail, and the most stunning details amounted to a nested structure of clearly visible rings and gaps in that disk.", "As the researchers involved in simulating protoplanetary disk structures took in these new observations, it became clear that such rings and gaps are commonly associated with \"", " bumps,\" where the local pressure is somewhat lower than in the surrounding regions. Those localized changes are typically associated with changes in disk composition, mostly in the size of dust grains.", "In particular, there are pressure bumps associated with particularly important transitions in the disk that can be linked directly to fundamental physics. Very close to the star, at temperatures higher than 1400 Kelvin, silicate compounds (think \"sand grains\") are gaseous\u2014it is simply too hot for them to exist in any other state. Of course, that means that planets cannot form in such a hot region. Below that temperature, silicate compounds \"sublimate,\" that is, any silicate gases directly transition to a solid state. This pressure bump defines an overall inner border for planet formation.", "Farther out, at 170 Kelvin (-100 degrees Celsius), there is a transition between water vapor on the one hand and water ice on the other hand, known as the water snowline. (The reason that temperature is so much lower than the standard 0 degrees Celsius where water freezes on Earth is the much lower pressure, compared to Earth's atmosphere.) At even lower temperatures, 30 Kelvin (-240 degrees Celsius), is the CO snowline; below that temperature, carbon monoxide forms a solid ice.", "What does this mean for the formation of planetary systems? Numerous earlier simulations had already shown how such pressure bumps facilitate the formation of planetesimals\u2014the small objects, between 10 and 100 kilometers in diameter, that are believed to be the building blocks for planets. After all, the formation process starts much, much smaller, namely with dust grains. Those dust grains tend to collect in the low-pressure region of a pressure bump, as grains of a certain size drift inwards (that is, towards the star) until they are stopped by the higher pressure at the inner boundary of the bump.", "As the grain concentration at the pressure bump increases, and in particular the ratio of solid material (which tends to aggregate) to gas (which tends to push grains apart) increases, it becomes easier for those grains to form pebbles, and for those pebbles to aggregate into larger objects. Pebbles are what astronomers call solid aggregates with sizes between a few millimeters and a few centimeters.", "But what had still be an open question was the role of those sub-structures in the overall shape of planetary systems, like our own Solar system, with its characteristic distribution of rocky, terrestrial inner planets and outer gaseous planets. This is the question that Andre Izidoro (Rice University), Bertram Bitsch of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and their colleagues took on. In their search for answers, they combined several simulations covering different aspects and different phases of planet formation.", "Specifically, the astronomers constructed a model of a gas disk, with three pressure bumps at the silicates-become-gaseous boundary and the water and CO snow lines. They then simulated the way that dust grains grow and fragment in the gas disk, the formation of planetesimals, the growth from planetesimals to planetary embryos (from 100 km in diameter to 2000 km) near the location of our Earth (\"1 astronomical unit\" distance from the sun), the growth of planetary embryos to planets for the terrestrial planets, and the accumulation of planetesimals in a newly-formed asteroid belt.", "In our own solar system, the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is home to hundreds of smaller bodies, which are believed to be remnants or collision fragments of planetesimals in that region that never grew to form planetary embryos, let alone planets.", "An interesting question for simulations is this: If the initial setup were just a little bit different, would the end result still be somewhat similar? Understanding these kinds of variations is important for understanding which of the ingredients are the key to the outcome of the simulation. That is why Bitsch and his colleagues analyzed a number of different scenarios with varying properties for the composition and for the temperature profile of the disk. In some of the simulations, they only the silicate and water ice pressure bumps, in others all three.", "The results suggest a direct link between the appearance of our solar system and the ring structure of its protoplanetary disk. Bertram Bitsch of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, who was involved both in planning this research program and in developing some of the methods that were used, says: \"For me, it was a complete surprise how well our models were able to capture the development of a planetary system like our own\u2014right down to the slightly different masses and chemical compositions of Venus, Earth and Mars.\"", "As expected, in those models, planetesimals in those simulations formed naturally near the pressure bumps, as a \"cosmic traffic jam\" for pebbles drifting inwards, which would then be stopped by the higher pressure at the inner boundary of the pressure bump.", "For the inner parts of the simulated systems, the researchers identified the right conditions for the formation of something like our own solar system: If the region right outside the innermost (silicate) pressure bump contains around 2.5 Earth masses' worth of planetesimals, these grow to form roughly Mars-sized bodies\u2014consistent with the inner planets within the solar system.", "A more massive disk, or else a higher efficiency of forming planetesimals, would instead lead to the formation of \"super-Earths,\" that is, considerably more massive rocky planets. Those super-Earths would be in close orbit around the host star, right up against that innermost pressure bump boundary. The existence of that boundary can also explain why there is no planet closer to the sun than Mercury\u2014the necessary material would simply have evaporated that close to the star.", "The simulations even go so far as to explain the slightly different chemical compositions of Mars on the one hand, Earth and Venus on the other: In the models, Earth and Venus indeed collect most of the material that will form their bulk from regions closer to the sun than the Earth's current orbit (one astronomical unit). The Mars-analogs in the simulations, in contrast, were built mostly from material from regions a bit farther away from the sun.", "Beyond the orbit of Mars, the simulations yielded a region that started out as sparsely populated with or, in some cases, even completely empty of planetesimals\u2014the precursor of the present-day asteroid belt of our solar systems. However, some planetesimals from the zones inside of or directly beyond would later stray into the asteroid belt region and become trapped.", "As those planetesimals collided, the resulting smaller pieces would form what we today observe as asteroids. The simulations are even able to explain the different asteroid populations: What astronomers call S-types asteroids, bodies that are made mostly of silica, would be the remnants of stray objects originating in the region around Mars, while C-type asteroids, which predominantly contain Carbon, would be the remnants of stray objects from the region directly outside the ", ".", "In that outer region, just outside the pressure bump that marks the inner limit for the presence of water ice, the simulations show the beginning of the formations of giant planets\u2014the planetesimals near that boundary typically have a total mass of between 40 and 100 times the mass of the Earth, consistent with estimates of the total mass of the cores of the giant planets in our solar system: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.", "In that situation, the most massive planetesimals would quickly gather more mass. The present simulations did not follow up on the (already well-studied) later evolution of those giant planets, which involves an initially rather tight group, from which Uranus and Neptune later migrated outwards to their present positions.", "Last but not least, the simulations can explain the final class of objects, and its properties: so-called Kuiper-belt objects, which formed outside the outermost pressure bump, which marks the inner boundary for the existence of carbon monoxide ice. It even can explain the slight differences in composition between known Kuiper-belt objects: again as the difference between planetesimals that formed originally outside the CO snowline pressure bump and stayed there, and planetesimals that strayed into the Kuiper belt from the adjacent inner region of the giant planets.", "Overall, the spread of simulations led to two basic outcomes: Either a pressure bump at the water-ice snowline formed very early; in that case, the inner and outer regions of the planetary system went their separate ways rather early on within the first hundred thousand years. This led to the formation of low-mass terrestrial planets in the inner parts of the system, similar to what happened in our own solar system.", "Alternatively, if the water-ice pressure bump forms later than that or is not as pronounced, more mass can drift into the inner region, leading instead to the formation of super-Earths or mini-Neptunes in the inner planetary systems. Evidence from the observations of those exoplanetary systems astronomers have found so far shows that case is by far the more probable\u2014and our own Solar system a comparatively rare outcome of planet formation.", "In this research, the focus of the astronomers was on the inner solar system and the terrestrial ", ". Next, they want to run simulations that include details of the outer regions, with Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The eventual aim is to arrive at a complete explanation for the properties of ours and other solar systems.", "For the inner solar system, at least, we now know that key properties of Earth and its nearest neighboring planet can be traced to some rather basic physics: the boundary between frozen water and water vapor and its associated pressure bump in the swirling disk of gas and dust that surrounded the young sun.", "The results described here have been published as A.
